# Configuration Management with Puppet

This repository contains Puppet manifests for three configuration management tasks using Puppet. The tasks include creating a file, installing a package, and executing a command. Each task is implemented using Puppet manifests and is described below.

## Task 0: Create a File

In this task, a Puppet manifest is used to create a file in the `/tmp` directory with specific permissions, owner, group, and content.

**Manifest File:** [0-create_a_file.pp](./0x0A-configuration_management/0-create_a_file.pp)

## Task 1: Install a Package

For this task, a Puppet manifest is provided to install a specific version of the Flask package using `pip3`.

**Manifest File:** [1-install_a_package.pp](./0x0A-configuration_management/1-install_a_package.pp)

## Task 2: Execute a Command

In this task, a Puppet manifest is used to execute a command that terminates a process named `killmenow` using `pkill`.

**Manifest File:** [2-execute_a_command.pp](./0x0A-configuration_management/2-execute_a_command.pp)

## How to Use

1. Install Puppet on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the appropriate task directory (e.g., `0x0A-configuration_management`).
