# Regular Expressions Project

This project involves working with regular expresion (regex) using Ruby and Oniguruma library. The goal is to create various regex patterns to match specific patterns.

## Project Files

The project directory contains the following files:

1. `0-simply_match_school.rb`: Ruby script that matches the word "School".
2. `1-repetition_token_0.rb`: Ruby script that uses a repetition token to match specific patterns.
3. `2-repetition_token_1.rb`: Ruby script that uses a repetition token to match specific patterns.
4. `3-repetition_token_2.rb`: Ruby script that uses a repetition token to match specific patterns.
5. `4-repetition_token_3.rb`: Ruby script that uses a repetition token to match specific patterns.
6. `5-beginning_and_end.rb`: Ruby script that matches a string starting with "h", ending with "n", and having any single character in between.
7. `6-phone_number.rb`: Ruby script that matches a 10-digit phone number.
8. `7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb`: Ruby script that matches capital letters.

## Instructions

To run any of the Ruby scripts, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Ruby and Oniguruma library installed on your system
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory
3. Make the Ruby script executable if needed `chmod +x <script_name>.rb`
4. Execute the Ruby script, providing any necessary arguments: `./<script_name>.rb <argument>`

Make sure to replace `<script_name>` with the actual name of the script file and `<argument>` with the appropriate input for each script.
