# Networking Basics :smile:

This repository contains a collection of tasks related to networking basics. The tasks cover various topics such as the OSI model, types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, TCP and UDP protocols and TCP/UDP ports. Each task is expained briefly and may require executing scripts or commands to complete.

## OSI Model
The model is conceptual framework that describes layered communication and network design. It consists of seven layers, ranging from the physical layer to the application layer. This task focuses on the Transport layer (TCP/UDP) and the Network layer (IP and ICMP)

## Types of Network

This task covers the different types of networks, including LAN and WAN. It explores  how LANs connect local devices, WANs connect LANs and WANs operate over the internet

## MAC and IP Address

The task provides an understanding of MAC (Media Access Control) and IP (Internet Protocol) address. It explains the role of MAC address as unique identifiers for network interface and how IP addresses function as network device identifiers.

## UDP and TCP

This task delves into UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). It describes the characteristics of each protocol, including their speed and reliability in data transmission.

## TCP and UDP Ports

In this task, the concept of TCP and UDP ports is explained. Ports act as communication endpoints for network devices, similar to windows and doors in a house. The task introduces commonly used ports and provides a Bash script to display listening ports.

## Is the Host on the Network

The final task involves using the ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) to check the availability of network devices on the network. It provides a Bash script that uses the ping command to check if an IP address is reachable.
