# What Happens When You Type "https://www.google.com" in Your Browser and Press Enter :wink:

This README provides an overview of the task to explain the process that occurs when you type "https://www.google.com" in your web browser and press Enter. The task includes creating a blog post and a diagram illustrating the flow of the request.

## Blog Post

To fulfill this task, a blog post was created to explain each step in detail. The blog post covers the following key components:

1. **DNS Request**: Explains how the Domain Name System (DNS) is used to resolve the domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address.

2. **TCP/IP**: Describes the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) and their role in establishing a connection.

3. **Firewall**: Discusses the purpose of a firewall in filtering and monitoring network traffic.

4. **HTTPS/SSL**: Explains the use of HTTPS and SSL/TLS encryption for secure communication.

5. **Load Balancer**: Details how load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers.

6. **Web Server**: Covers the web server's role in processing requests and generating HTML responses.

7. **Application Server**: Explains how an application server may be involved in generating dynamic content.

8. **Database**: Describes the interaction between the application server and the database server for data retrieval.

9. **Response to Browser**: Explains how the web server delivers the final web page to the browser.

## Diagram

A schema diagram illustrating the flow of the request was also created. The diagram includes the following elements:

- **DNS resolution**: Represents the step where DNS resolves the domain name.
- **TCP/IP connection**: Shows the establishment of a TCP/IP connection.
- **Encryption**: Indicates the use of encryption (HTTPS/SSL) for secure communication.
- **Firewall**: Depicts the firewall through which traffic may pass.
- **Load Balancer**: Represents the load balancer distributing requests.
- **Web Server**: Illustrates the web server processing the request.
- **Application Server**: Demonstrates the application server's involvement.
- **Database**: Shows the interaction with the database server.
- **Response to Browser**: Indicates the final response sent to the browser.

## Contribution to "What Happens When" Project

As an additional step, a contribution was made to the ["What Happens When" GitHub project](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when#the-g-key-is-pressed). The contribution aimed to enhance the collective understanding of various internet-related processes.

Please note that this README file provides an overview, and the detailed content, including the blog post and diagram, can be found in the respective files within the project directory.

Feel free to explore the blog post and diagram for a comprehensive understanding of what happens when you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser and press Enter.
