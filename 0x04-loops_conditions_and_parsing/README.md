# Bash Scripting Project: Loops, Conditions, and Parsing

This project focuses on developing Bash scripts to demonstrate various concepts related to loops, conditions, and parsing. The scripts are designed to achieve objectives and enhance your understanding of Bash scripting.

## SSH RSA key pair

In this task, we generate an RSA key pair for secure access to remote server via SSH. The generated public key is shared in the `0-RSA_public_key,pub` file.

## For Best School loop

A Bash script (`1-for_best_school`) that displays "Best School" 10 times using a for loop.

## While Best School loop

A Bash script (`2-while_best_school`) that displays "Best School" 10 times using a while loop.

## Until Best School loop

A Bash script (`3-until_best_school`) that displays "Best School" 10 times using an until loop.

## If 9, say Hi!

A Bash script (`4-if_9_say_hi`) that displays "Best School" 10 times, but on the 9th iteration, it displays "Hi" on a new line.

## 4 bad luck, 8 is your chance

A Bash script (`5-4_bad_luck_8_is_your_chance`) that loops from 1 to 10 and displays "bad luck" for the 4th iteration, "good luck" for the 8th iteration, and "Best School" for the other iterations.

## Superstitious numbers

A Bash script (`6-superstitious_numbers`) that displays numbers from 1 to 20 and displays specific messages for the 4th, 9th, and 17th iterations based on different countries' superstitions.

## Clock

A Bash script (`7-clock`) that displays the time for 12 hours and 59 minutes, showing hours from 0 to 12 and minutes from 1 to 59.

## For ls

A Bash script (`8-for_ls`) that lists the content of the current directory in a specific format, displaying only the part of the name after the first dash.

## To file, or not to file

A Bash script (`9-to_file_or_not_to_file`) that provides information about the "school" file, including existence, emptiness, and regular file status.

## FizzBuzz

A Bash script (`10-fizzbuzz`) that displays numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz".

Feel free to explore each script file in the repository for the detailed implementation of each task.

**Note:** Make sure to meet the requirements mentioned in each task description.
